# Bee-colony-optimization

The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a nature-inspired meta-heuristic method for dealing with hard, real-life combinatorial and continuous optimisation problems. It is based on the foraging habits of honeybees and was proposed by Dervis Karaboga in 2005. ABC is a simple, but effective meta-heuristic method that has already been successfully applied to various combinatorial optimization problems in transport, location analysis, scheduling and some other elds.
