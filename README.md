# Abstract

The Nurse Rostering Problem (NRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that is tackled
by assigning a set of nurses with different skills and contracts to different types of shifts,
over a predefined scheduling period. An efficient nurse scheduling process allows hospitals
to better handle last-minute changes and stay in compliance with labor laws. It also ensures
smooth and effective communication among employees, and between schedulers and
employees. The nurse rostering problem is characterized by the presence of a large set of
constraints, which are usually divided into two categories: hard and soft constraints. Hard
constraints are those that are rigidly enforced and should be met at all times. Violations
of the soft constraints are to be avoided, if possible. Bee Colony Optimization (BCO)
algorithm is proposed to tackle the NRP tested on a dataset of 30 nurses introduced in the
First International Nurse Rostering Competition (INRC2010). The algorithm iteratively
searches for the solution by going through a validation process which involves filtering
the solution through all the constraints. The results produced by the proposed algorithm
are very promising when compared with those produced by the five INRC2010 winnersâ€™
methods. Further investigation is still necessary for further improvement of the proposed
algorithm.
